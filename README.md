##The beginnings of learning WebDev

Welcome to the learning experience that is building [my website](http://griffincodes.tech/). I love learning new things, and creating a website seemed like a perfect excuse to try something new. 

**Things to note**

This project is relatively new, and not complete. There are several errors, and I am aware of ~~all~~ most of them.

Things I plan on adding:

1. Security - I need to implement SSL/TLS, and I am currenly learning more about cryptography/encryption. 
2. Test plan - So far, the project is small, and debugging is easy. However, I will need to implement a proper debugging plan soon.
3. Content - The webpage will likely be home to my projects, and I would like to host some interesting and interactive applications. Suggestions welcome!
4. Design - I am not very artistic, and the webpage reflects this. Need to completely overhaul the design. I did learn a lot about SVGs, so not a complete waste of time.
5. Properly format the HTML - 2 spaces instead of some tabs for redability.

Welcome to my journey! Feel free to reach out with suggestions, advice, comments, questions, opinions, confessions, harsh criticism, jokes, random thoughts...
