## My experience learning WebDev
Welcome to the learning experience that is building [my website](http://griffincodes.tech/). I love learning new things, and creating a website seemed like a perfect excuse to try something new! 


**Things to note**

This project is relatively new, and not complete. There are several errors, and I am aware of ~~all~~ most of them. I am trying to build everything as quickly as possible when I have breaks from schoolwork. Additionally, I am aware there are plug-n-play technologies available that produce professional websites very quickly. However, using these products defeats the purpose of creating my own website so I can learn.


**Things I plan on adding:**
1. Security - I need to implement SSL/TLS, and I am currenly learning more about cryptography/encryption. 
2. Test plan - So far, the project is small, and debugging is easy. However, I will need to implement a proper debugging plan soon.
3. Content - The webpage will likely be home to my projects, and I would like to host some interesting and interactive applications. Suggestions welcome!
4. Design - I am not very artistic, and the webpage reflects this. Need to completely overhaul the design. I did learn a lot about SVGs, so not a complete waste of time.
5. Properly format the HTML/Java - 2 spaces instead of some tabs for redability, and properly wrap the lines of IndexGenerator.
6. More JavaScript - Find an excuse to add more JS and expand my abilities in the language.
7. SQL? - Find and excuse to create a database because... It sounds fun.
8. Clean up style.css - Plenty of unused/obsolete classes and such that can be removed for readability and make room for future changes.
9. Learning Maven for the first time, tons of weird problems. Figure out what all this nonsense means or switch to something lighter...
